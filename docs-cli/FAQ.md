## 5. Linux Login Cannot Open Browser

- Method 1: Open the terminal in VSCode and remotely connect to Linux. VSCode can open the browser.

- Method 2: Copy the URL on the interface and manually open it in the browser. (Note: Mobaxterm cannot copy URLs. You need to switch to another terminal, such as directly using the ssh command to connect to the server)

- Method 3: Log in to CoStrict on Windows first (either CLI or plugin), then copy %USER_PROFILE%/.costrict/share/auth.json to the server at ${HOME}/.costrict/share/auth.json, and then use it (after expiration, perform the same operation again). If the directory does not exist, please create it automatically.

## 6. Windows 7 Cannot Be Used

Start the CoStrict CLI web mode on a remote Linux server, then open it in a browser; or use VSCode to remotely connect to the server for development.
