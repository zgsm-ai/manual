# Custom Agents

## Overview

There are two types of agents in CoStrict: primary agents and sub-agents. Primary agents are the main assistants you interact with directly. You can switch between them using the `<Tab>` key.

Sub-agents are specialized assistants that primary agents can invoke for specific tasks. You can also manually invoke them by **@mentioning** them in messages.

## Agent File Placement

● Global: `~/.config/costrict/agents/`

● Project: `.costrict/agents/`

## Example

You can create an agent using a command:

```
cs agent create
```

Or manually create a file.

In the project root directory, create .costrict/agents/review.md:

```

mode: primary

You are in code review mode. Focus on:

- Code quality and best practices
- Potential bugs and edge cases
- Performance implications
- Security considerations

Provide constructive feedback without making direct changes.
```

- Parameter description: The mode option can be set to primary, subagent, or all. If mode is not specified, the default value is all.

**Note**: After configuring the agent, it is recommended to restart the CLI to load the agent.
