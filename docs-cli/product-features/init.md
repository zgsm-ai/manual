# Project Knowledge Initialization

**In Build mode, enter /init**, then press Enter to execute. AI will perform a deep analysis of the project, **estimated to take about 10 minutes**.

This will generate an [AGENTS.md](https://AGENTS.md) file containing information about the project's technology stack, directory structure, specifications, and constraints. This file will be automatically sent to the AI in each conversation, enabling the AI to have a global understanding of the project.

Generate once, reuse multiple times. You can manually edit and modify this file to add your own rules.
