# Skills

Skills extend the capabilities of CoStrict CLI through custom commands and workflows.

## Overview

Skills are reusable command templates that encapsulate common workflows and best practices.

## Skill File Placement

Create a folder for each skill name and place a SKILL.md in it. CoStrict will search these locations:

● Project configuration: `.costrict/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

● Global configuration: `~/.config/costrict/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

● Project Claude compatible: `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

● Global Claude compatible: `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

## Writing Example

In the project root directory, create `.costrict/skills/git-release/SKILL.md` as follows:

```
---
name: git-release
description: Create consistent releases and changelogs
---

## What I do

- Draft release notes from merged PRs
- Propose a version bump
- Provide a copy-pasteable `gh release create` command

## When to use me

Use this when you are preparing a tagged release.
Ask clarifying questions if the target versioning scheme is unclear.
```

**Note:**

- After writing, restart the CLI program to load Skills.

- name requirements:

● Length of 1-64 characters
● Composed of lowercase alphanumeric characters, separated by single hyphens
● Cannot start or end with -
● Must not contain consecutive --
● Match the directory name containing SKILL.md

Equivalent regular expression:

```
^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$
```

description must be 1-1024 characters. Make sure it's specific enough for the agent to select correctly.
