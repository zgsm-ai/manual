1.2 Based on the positioning and functions of Sangfor's main business and products, we will primarily provide account registration and related functions/services to adult users. Before any entity instructs/authorizes a minor to register relevant product accounts or use products through any other means, it shall be responsible for obtaining consent from their guardian, and verifying the true identity of the authorized minor and their guardian through ID number, and shall pay attention to specially protecting the legitimate rights and interests such as personal information of that minor user throughout the entire use period.

##### 2. User Information

2.1 Users shall fill in and submit authentic, legal, and effective information in accordance with requirements, including but not limited to user names, contact persons, email addresses, contact phone numbers, so that Sangfor may conduct real-name authentication on the identity of relevant subjects by itself or by entrusting a third party in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, or use it when necessary to verify the authenticity and legality of businesses carried out by relevant subjects using products or other related services provided by Sangfor. If any of the aforementioned information changes, You shall notify Sangfor in writing in a timely manner or update it Yourself according to the usage rules of specific products.

2.2 Users shall guarantee that information such as their registered account names, avatars, and profile descriptions (if any) will not contain any content that violates laws and regulations, public policies, social security, public order and good morals, or infringes upon the legitimate rights and interests of any third party, including but not limited to: not impersonating, falsely claiming, fabricating the names or logos of political parties, party, government and military organs, enterprises and institutions, people's groups and social organizations, countries (regions), international organizations, news media, as well as important geographical names, logos, etc.; not impersonating others (including but not limited to administrators) or unauthorized use of others' names, portraits or trademarks/logos; not intentionally containing QR codes, URLs, email addresses, contact information, etc.; and not containing content such as being untrue to the name, exaggerated, etc. that may mislead the public or cause misunderstanding.

##### 3. Account Use Behavioral Specifications

3.1 During the period when Users log in to product accounts and use relevant functions/services, they shall consciously assume legal obligations related to the account entity, including but not limited to not utilizing any product functions through account login or other means to engage in behaviors that violate laws, regulations, or policy requirements, not interfering with Sangfor product operation or Sangfor's operational management of products through any technical means, not maliciously circumventing or resisting the rules of relevant functions/services, or breaking through account authorities or other use restrictions, not publishing or disseminating illegal or false information content or publishing advertisements through any means, not interfering with other Users' normal use of products through methods such as brushing posts, watering, fake rewards, etc., or infringing upon legitimate rights and interests of others through any other means.

##### 4. Account Security Protection

4.1 Accounts will serve as the basis for identity recognition of Users' use of corresponding products. You shall take necessary and effective protection measures (including but not limited to conducting effective permission control, setting high-strength passwords and changing them regularly, etc.) for account names, passwords, and other information and account security.

4.2 If You discover that others are stealing Your accounts and passwords, or any other situations where Your account use permissions are obtained by others without Your legal authorization, You shall immediately notify Sangfor in effective ways and provide necessary materials (such as situation explanations, proving materials, specific requests and contact information, etc.). After Sangfor receives Your effective notice and verifies identity, confirms the fact situation, it will handle matters according to laws and regulations and agreement/rule agreements. Relevant responsibilities and consequences resulting from Sangfor's handling according to this Article shall be borne by You. If materials provided by You have flaws, resulting in Sangfor being unable to verify Your identity or unable to judge Your needs and thus failing to handle in time, resulting in You suffering losses, You shall bear them yourself. At the same time, **You understand that Sangfor needs a reasonable period to handle Your requests. For losses You have already suffered before Sangfor takes measures, and for losses caused after Sangfor takes measures for reasons not attributable to Sangfor, Sangfor does not bear any responsibility.**

##### 5. Account Management

5.1 Besides account security protection, You should also establish and improve internal management systems and standardize the use and management of accounts. If any user actually violates this Agreement or other relevant rules or agreements, You have the obligation to immediately notify us, and at the same time should take appropriate actions to stop and correct relevant violation/breach behaviors, and be responsible for bearing all relevant responsibilities.

5.2 You understand and agree: As the operation party of products, Sangfor will have the right to take necessary measures including but not limited to limiting, suspending, or terminating access/use of corresponding products or other related services, in accordance with relevant laws or this Agreement and other relevant agreements, when any user exists in behaviors violating this Agreement or other relevant rules/agreements, or disputes related to account authority occur, in order to ensure the safe and effective operation of products to the greatest extent possible. If this results in users losing or clearing data related to their use of relevant products, Users shall be responsible for bearing them themselves; and Sangfor has the right to independently evaluate and establish a user account credit management system, and provide services or other relevant rights and interest guarantees to Users according to credit evaluation situations during the user account use period.

##### 6. Account Authority Limitations and Termination

###### 6.1 Account Cancellation

Generally, users with Sangfor product use accounts may independently operate to cancel accounts, or apply to Sangfor for account cancellation through contact methods in this Agreement body or other exclusive contact methods. Any account cancellation must meet the following conditions:

6.1.1 The account is in a normal state, not involving any dispute disputes (including complaints reports or being complained and reported), and not being subject to restriction measures by competent authorities;

6.1.2 There are no unfinished transactions within the account;

6.1.3 There are no outstanding rights and obligations within the account or situations where disputes may arise due to account cancellation;

6.1.4 There are no other situations that may affect account cancellation.

Sangfor will stop providing corresponding product functions and other related services to users whose accounts have been officially cancelled. After account cancellation, we will properly handle relevant data according to requirements of relevant laws and regulations and relevant agreements with You (if any).

6.2 To protect user account security, Sangfor has the right to independently detect and judge behaviors with abnormal access and take corresponding handling measures. For example, for accounts that have not logged in for a long time after registration or have no access or operation records for a long time after logging in, to protect user account security, Sangfor has the right to limit their login functions, and users need to reactivate accounts or log in again before they can use normally.

6.3 When Users violate relevant agreements of this Agreement or suspension or termination conditions of account use license authorities agreed upon between both Parties are achieved, Sangfor has the right to recover or terminate the use permission of the account used by You.
