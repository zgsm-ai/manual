It can systematically decompose requirements for user-provided needs, including requirement design, architecture design, test design, code design, and other steps, to output high-quality programming code for users. To provide you with CoStrict's functions and services, continuously maintain the normal operation of various functions and services, timely identify abnormal account status, ensure your account security as much as possible, and continuously improve and optimize the application usage experience, we will collect and use information you actively provide, authorize and provide or provided based on the requirements of your entity's users during registration and use of the application for the purposes described below under this Policy, as well as information generated when you use this application:

With your consent, we will obtain the public information you registered on the third-party platform (including account name, avatar, nickname and other information you authorize), which will be used to bind with the CoStrict account so that you can directly log in and use this product and related services. Currently, CoStrict only supports login through GitHub accounts. Based on the aforementioned purposes, we will record your authorized and synchronized **GitHub username and nickname information, ID, avatar, and email address information bound to the account**.

### 1.2 Information collected during the use of CoStrict

1.2.1 Generally, CoStrict services need to be pre-purchased before use, and users can purchase only after logging in to their accounts. During the purchase process, we will only record page response status and whether the purchase is successful through logs, without collecting other personal information from users. After the purchase is completed, users can request invoices. When users choose the invoice title as personal, they only need to provide an **email address** to receive electronic invoices. When users choose the invoice title as an enterprise, they must accurately provide the invoice title information and fill in an **email address** to receive electronic invoices.

All plain text code only exists during request processing and is destroyed after the request ends; although embedding vectors and metadata of the code repository (including hash values and file names) may be stored in our database, the actual code content you uploaded will not be retained. Except for the use scenarios and purposes listed in this privacy policy and the fulfillment of legal obligations, we will not use the code files you uploaded and generated for any other scenarios not authorized by you, including not providing them to other third parties or using them as model training corpus;

We promise to explicitly inform you of the specific sharing purpose, method and information scope before sharing, and seek your consent.

We promise to you that we will only share relevant personal information with partners within the necessary scope, and de-identify the information as much as possible so that partners cannot directly identify relevant individuals.

Due to user's own reasons such as informing others of the product/service account password used or violating the agreement of product/service use, or due to third-party reasons such as hacker attack/virus intrusion, or force majeure factors resulting in security events such as user information leakage/loss, you understand that Sangfor will not be able to bear any direct or indirect losses or responsibilities.
