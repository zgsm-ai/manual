# Code Completion

When you are writing code in the VSCode editor, CoStrict will automatically provide line-level or function-level code suggestions based on the context of the current and related code files. You can then use shortcut keys`enter` to accept or `esc` to dismiss these suggestions. CoStrict supports accepting completions by word or by line.
