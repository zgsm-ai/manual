# Strict Mode (Spec Mode)

Serious programming following the **"Requirement Clarification → Design → Task Decomposition → Self-Testing with Self-Repair"** workflow. Suitable for complex tasks.

## New Spec Mode Enhances Understanding of Existing Projects, Making AI Programming More Reliable

## Built-in Intelligent Tools to Enhance Generation Quality and Improve Coding Standards

CoStrict includes multiple intelligent tools to enhance generation quality, including project understanding, testing strategies, and troubleshooting.

### 2.1 Project Understanding

The large model generates a project knowledge base and rules **"optimized for AI reading"** to help AI understand business logic and improve code generation accuracy.

### 2.2 Testing Strategy

Analyzes and generates project testing strategies, which can be used in both Spec Mode and Vibe Mode.

### 2.3 Troubleshooting

Input problem logs or fault descriptions, and AI assists in locating the root cause and providing repair solutions.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [CoStrict 2.0 User Manual](/plugin/best-practices/user-manual).

## Supporting Intelligent Collaboration Workflow for More Efficient and Controllable Development

Spec Mode supports visualization and editing of the task process, allowing developers to directly modify documents during execution and collaborate with AI in real-time. The entire workflow follows the automated chain of **"Requirement Clarification → Design → Task Decomposition → Self-Testing with Self-Repair."** When requirement documents are updated, they can be synchronized to the design and implementation stages with one click. At the same time, decomposed subtasks can be executed and tested independently, making the overall process more efficient and controllable.

### 3.1 Visualizable and Editable Task Process

During execution, corresponding documents can be edited to collaborate with AI.

### 3.2 Automatic Process Synchronization

Following the **"Requirement Clarification → Design → Task Decomposition → Self-Testing with Self-Repair"** workflow, when requirement documents are updated, clicking update will automatically synchronize to the design stage.

### 3.3 Independent Execution of Subtasks

Each task decomposed from requirements can be executed and tested independently, making tasks more controllable.
