# CoStrict Service Level Agreement

To use the CoStrict AI programming service (hereinafter referred to as "the Service"), you must read and comply with the "CoStrict Service Level Agreement" (hereinafter referred to as "this Agreement" or "SLA"), as well as the "CoStrict Service Agreement". This Agreement includes terms and definitions related to the Service, service availability/service success rate indicators, compensation plans, disclaimers, and other relevant content. Please read carefully and fully understand each clause, especially those that may be highlighted in **bold** or underlined to draw your attention to important limitations, disclaimers, or other clauses that may significantly affect your rights.

Unless you have fully read, understood, and accepted all terms of this Agreement, please do not purchase the Service. By clicking "Agree", "Next", or by purchasing, using, or otherwise expressly or implicitly accepting this Agreement, you acknowledge that you have read and agreed to be bound by this Agreement. This Agreement shall become legally binding between you and Sangfor, constituting a legally enforceable agreement for both parties.

## 1. Terms and Definitions

### 1.1 CoStrict

CoStrict is an open-source AI programming tool developed by Sangfor, designed for enterprise-level serious development scenarios. It supports VS Code and JetBrains IDEs, offering capabilities including but not limited to AI code review, test-driven self-verification and self-repair, specification-driven development, and reverse documentation generation from legacy code.

### 1.2 Service Billing Cycle

The Service billing cycle refers to the valid usage period of the Credits you purchase. It is calculated from the date of successful Credit purchase and is valid for 30 calendar days.

### 1.3 Service Unavailability

If, within any given minute, all your attempts to access or connect to the CoStrict service fail due to reasons attributable to Sangfor, and you are unable to use the CoStrict service at all, that minute is considered as service unavailable. If you are able to use part of the service or if some requests succeed within that minute, the service is considered available, and that minute is not counted towards the unavailable minutes in the billing cycle. Exceptions are outlined in Article 4 of this Agreement.

### 1.4 Unavailable Minutes in a Billing Cycle

The total number of minutes during which the service was unavailable within a natural month.

### 1.5 Total Service Minutes in a Billing Cycle

Calculated as: number of days in the natural month × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).

### 1.6 Credits

Credits are the billing unit for the CoStrict service. Users consume Credits to use the CoStrict service. Different AI models consume Credits at different rates, as published on the CoStrict official website.

## 2. Service Availability / Service Success Rate

### 2.1 Service Availability Calculation

Service Availability = (1 - Unavailable Minutes in Billing Cycle / Total Service Minutes in Billing Cycle) × 100%

Example: If the CoStrict service is unavailable from 23:00 to 23:05 on a day in April 2024, resulting in 5 minutes of downtime, then the service availability for April 2024 = 1 - 5 / (30 × 24 × 60) × 100% = 99.98%

### 2.2 Service Availability Standard

Sangfor guarantees a service availability of no less than 99.9%. If this standard is not met (except for cases covered under the disclaimer clauses), you are eligible for compensation as outlined in Article 3 of this Agreement.

## 3. Compensation Plan

If the service availability falls below the standard, you are entitled to compensation as follows:

### 3.1 Compensation Standard

(1) Compensation will be provided in the form of Credits issued by Sangfor. These Credits can only be used by you through your CoStrict account for the Service and cannot be used for other services, nor can they be transferred or gifted.

(2) If the service availability standard is not met in a natural month, compensation is calculated separately for that month. The total compensation amount shall not exceed the Credits you actually consumed in that month (calculated based on the price at the time of purchase).

| Monthly Service Availability | Compensation Credit Amount |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Below 99% but ≥ 98.5%     | 5% of monthly Credits  |
| Below 98.5% but ≥ 98.0%     | 10% of monthly Credits |
| Below 98.0% but ≥ 97.5%     | 20% of monthly Credits |
| Below 95.0%                 | 50% of monthly Credits |

### 3.2 Compensation Application Deadline

(1) If the service availability standard is not met in a natural month, you may submit a compensation request only through your account's ticketing system or official customer service email after the fifth (5th) working day of the following month. Upon receiving your request, Sangfor will verify the claim. In case of disputes regarding the calculation of monthly service availability, both parties agree that Sangfor's backend records shall prevail.

(2) You must submit your compensation request no later than sixty (60) calendar days after the end of the month in which the service availability standard was not met. If you fail to submit a request within sixty (60) days, or submit it after sixty (60) days, or submit it through means not specified in this Agreement, you will be deemed to have waived your right to compensation and any other claims against Sangfor, and Sangfor reserves the right to reject your compensation request without any compensation or reimbursement.

### 3.3 Compensation Application Materials

If you believe the service availability standard has not been met, you may initiate a compensation request within the timeframe specified in this SLA. Your request must include at least the following information:

(1) Account experiencing service unavailability.  
(2) Duration of service unavailability and other relevant evidence.

## 4. Disclaimer

Service unavailability caused by the following reasons is excluded from the calculation of service unavailability and Sangfor's compensation obligations, and Sangfor shall not be held liable:

4.1 Loss or leakage of data, passwords, or credentials due to your improper maintenance or confidentiality.  
4.2 Issues caused by your negligent authorization, incorrect operations, or your own equipment or third-party software/hardware.  
4.3 Failure to follow CoStrict product documentation or usage recommendations.  
4.4 Usage exceeding the service capacity limits of your current paid plan.  
4.5 Service interruptions due to system maintenance notified in advance by Sangfor, including but not limited to cut-over, repairs, upgrades, and fault simulation drills.  
4.6 Unavailability during routine system maintenance, or due to implicit dependencies on cloud server, database, load balancer, network, or monitoring services.  
4.7 Network, equipment failures, or configuration adjustments outside of Sangfor's infrastructure.  
4.8 Service disruptions caused by attacks or other improper behavior targeting your application interfaces or data.  
4.9 Errors resulting from account suspension due to content violations or other reasons.  
4.10 Service unavailability or substandard performance not caused by Sangfor.  
4.11 Circumstances where Sangfor is exempt from liability or compensation as stipulated in applicable laws, agreements, rules, or separately published policies.  
4.12 Service unavailability due to IDE plugin compatibility issues.  
4.13 Service unavailability caused by interruptions from third-party AI model providers.

## 5. Miscellaneous

5.1 Both parties acknowledge and agree that, under any circumstances, if you suffer losses due to Sangfor's breach of contract during your use of the Service, the total compensation for breach of contract shall not exceed the total service fees you have paid for the Service in the past 12 months.

5.2 Sangfor reserves the right to modify the terms of this Agreement as necessary. You may review the latest version of the Agreement on the CoStrict official website (https://costrict.ai). If you do not agree with any modifications, you have the right to discontinue using the Service. Continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of the modified Agreement.

5.3 This Agreement is a supplementary agreement to the "CoStrict Purchase Terms" and holds equal legal effect. Matters not covered herein shall be governed by the "CoStrict Purchase Terms". In case of conflict or inconsistency between this Agreement and the "CoStrict Purchase Terms", this Agreement shall prevail, but only to the extent of such conflict or inconsistency.
