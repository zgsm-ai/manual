# Credit 

## Credit Description

CoStrict provides users with free access, but due to limited computing resources, in order to ensure a good user experience under large-scale user requests, CoStrict adopts a usage calculation method based on the Credit quota (similar to points rules). When you have Credits, you can use CoStrict normally (usage from other suppliers is not affected). New users registering or participating in official operational activities will receive Credit quota rewards.

Credits are calculated based on a base of 1 Credit per conversation or request, with different models having different consumption rates (the charging standards of models are different, and the consumption of tokens is also different, for example: the deepseekr1 model may consume 0.5 Credits per request, but for the Claude model, it may be 1.5 Credits). The actual deduction ratio is subject to the actual amount.

You can view the total amount and consumption of Credits on the account page of the CoStrict plugin, click "View Account Details" to jump to the user information & quota usage page on the web, and check the "Usage" module for the total amount and consumption of Credits.

Users can check the expiration time of the credit in the "Credit Validity Period" area under the "Usage" module, and please consume in time within the validity period.

## Credit Acquisition

The official has launched multiple Credit methods: new users who register will receive a reward quota of 50 Credits; the official will also gift around 10 Credits each week. If you participate in official operational activities, such visiting Github to add a Star to the CoStrict project (link address: https://github.com/zgsm-ai/costrict), We will also have a reward quota. (The reward quota is adjusted periodically, so the actual amount received shall prevail.)
